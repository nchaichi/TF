# TF Package
## TF or technology forecasting package uses three growth curve ― Pearl, Gompertz, and Bass ― to forecast the trend of technology adoption or technological improvement. There are two options in package for Pearl and Gompertz methods to determine the coefficients of the curve ― analogy and historical data. Though, this package do not provide the historical data option for Bass curve, since using second degree regression model as proposed by Bass might not lead to the coefficient with right sign.
